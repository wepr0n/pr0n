# pr0n - firefox add-on for http://www.wepr0n.com

  pr0n is the first social add-on for Mozilla Firefox exclusively dedicated to
  porn! For too many years they have told us that on-line pornography is evil,
  wrong and socially unacceptable. Now we have pr0n: the first add-on
  completely dedicated to transforming on-line pornography in a social
  experience based on sharing.

  Respecting of your privacy and your anonymity, let's rediscover the pleasure
  of sharing sites and ideas, getting the best from the web using pr0n, Mozilla
  Firefox and being part of a community.

  Then cooperate, proposing new ideas and new features! Vote for others
  proposals too! Follow what is under development!

  Today begins a new era for pornography.

  We pr0n, don't you?
